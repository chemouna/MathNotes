## Combinatorics

### Inclusion–exclusion principle
the inclusion–exclusion principle is a counting technique which generalizes the familiar method of obtaining the number of elements in the union of two finite sets
|A union B|= |A|+|B| - |A Intersect B|

### Catalan Numbers
The Catalan numbers on nonnegative integers n are a set of numbers that arise in tree enumeration problems of the type, "In how many ways can a regular n-gon be divided into n-2 triangles 
if different orientations are counted separately?

Applications:
- Cn counts the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched
- Cn is the number of different ways n + 1 factors can be completely parenthesized (or the number of ways of associating n applications of a binary operator). 
- Cn is the number of full binary trees with n + 1 leaves.

- Cn is the number of noncrossing partitions of the set {1, ..., n}. A fortiori, Cn never exceeds the nth Bell number. Cn is also the number of noncrossing partitions of the set {1, ..., 2n} in which every block is of size 2.
