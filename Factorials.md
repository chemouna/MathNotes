## Factorial in Number theory
* For n >= 1, a(n) is the number of n X n (0,1) matrices with each row and column containing exactly one entry equal to 1.

* n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if
   (n - 1)! = 0 (mod n)

### Wilson Theorem 
 (p - 1)! = -1 (mod p)
