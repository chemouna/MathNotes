## Handshaking lemma
-  every finite undirected graph has an even number of vertices with odd degree (the number of edges touching the vertex). In more colloquial terms, in a party of people some of whom shake hands, an even number of people must have shaken an odd number of other people's hands. The handshaking lemma is a consequence of the degree sum formula.
